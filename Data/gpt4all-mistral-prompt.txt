The task is to fix the following C++ code with the given error message and provide a description of the resolution of the error in JSON format.
The input will be formatted in JSON.
The note message will help a lot in order to figure out the error.
The line and column numbers are also provided in the JSON object.
The source C++ code is provided and it is contained in the "code" label of the JSON object provided.
The error message is in the "error" label of the JSON object provided.
The note message is in the "note" label of the JSON object provided, if any.

Example:
{"./Project1/Dog.cpp": [{"code": "    ptr2 = &val;\n\n    std::cout << \"Hello World!!!\" << std::endl\n    return 0;\n}\n","column": 47,"error": "expected ';' before 'return'","file": "./compilecode/Project1/hello_world.cpp","line": 11}]}

Response:
{"code": "    ptr2 = &val;\n\n    std::cout << \"Hello World!!!\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n"}

The error was caused by a missing semicolon in line 11, column 47. As a result, a semicolon was added after the std::endl statement in order to solve the compiler error.

End of Example
